            <h2 id="history" class="section-title">History</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies have a history that’s as revolutionary as it is exciting. It all began in 2009, when Bitcoin was introduced by a mysterious figure named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was a groundbreaking idea: a type of money that didn’t need banks, governments, or any central authority. Instead, Bitcoin relied on technology called <strong>blockchain</strong>, which records every transaction in a way that’s secure and transparent. This innovation was the first of its kind and captured the attention of tech enthusiasts, investors, and curious thinkers around the world.</p>
            <p>In the early years, Bitcoin was mostly discussed in online forums, and only a few people were involved. But in 2010, Bitcoin experienced its first major transaction when <strong>a user famously paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas</strong>. This simple event marked Bitcoin’s shift from concept to real-world value and would later inspire people everywhere to see cryptocurrency as more than just an experiment.</p>
            <p>As Bitcoin gained popularity, new cryptocurrencies started emerging, each with unique goals and technologies. By the late 2010s, cryptocurrencies were gaining serious attention from investors, tech companies, and even governments. The concept of decentralized finance, or DeFi, began to take shape, allowing people to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their crypto holdings without needing a bank.</p>
            <p>In 2020 and beyond, cryptocurrencies saw <strong>unprecedented growth</strong>, partly due to the interest of big companies and well-known investors. This period also brought the rise of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which allowed for unique digital ownership of art, music, and more—all powered by blockchain technology. Today, cryptocurrencies are not just a topic for tech insiders; <strong>they’re part of a broader financial revolution</strong> that’s transforming the way people think about money and ownership.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Coins</h3>
                    <p>Coins are the main digital currency on their own blockchains. Think of them as the backbone of their blockchain’s economy—they’re used to reward network participants and to pay for transactions. For example, Bitcoin is the native coin of its blockchain, and miners earn BTC for their work maintaining the network. Ethereum works the same way, with validators earning ETH as a reward and users paying transaction fees in Gwei (a small unit of ETH). Coins can serve as digital currency, like BTC as a store of value, or power blockchain-specific applications like XRP, which is used in cross-border transactions on the Ripple network.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Tokens</h3>
                    <p>Tokens are digital assets built on existing blockchains. Instead of requiring their own blockchains, tokens rely on the infrastructure of platforms like Ethereum to operate. Tokens can represent assets, services, or even voting rights within a network, making them flexible tools in the crypto ecosystem. Creating a token is straightforward, often following standard protocols (like Ethereum’s ERC-20), so anyone can create one without building an entire blockchain. For example, the Uniswap exchange has its own token (UNI), but users still need ETH to cover the transaction fees when trading on Uniswap’s platform.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                    <p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that maintain a stable value by being tied to a steady asset, like the U.S. dollar or gold. This stability makes them popular for transactions, as they avoid the price swings typical of other cryptocurrencies. For example, USD Coin (USDC) is backed by actual dollars held in reserve, keeping its value close to $1. Traders use stablecoins to quickly switch between cryptocurrencies without cashing out to traditional money. This stability brings reliability to the crypto market, especially for those wanting to avoid extreme volatility.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Exchange Tokens</h3>
                    <p>Exchange tokens are created by crypto exchanges as a way to engage and reward users on their platforms. By holding these tokens, users often get benefits like reduced trading fees or special rewards. For example, Binance’s BNB token provides users with lower transaction fees and opportunities for staking rewards on the Binance exchange. Exchange tokens serve multiple purposes, such as raising funds for the exchange’s growth or providing users with governance rights, which means they can have a say in the exchange’s future.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    <h3>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)</h3>
                    <p>NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are unique digital assets that represent ownership of one-of-a-kind items, like digital art, music, or even event tickets. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, each NFT has its own unique value and metadata, which make it different from all others. NFTs are popular in art and collectibles and have opened up new ways for creators to monetize digital work. Each NFT is verifiable on the blockchain, providing proof of ownership and authenticity, which has revolutionized the way people buy, sell, and trade digital assets.</p>
